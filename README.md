# Online Multiplayer Game (Python)

This project is part of a Python Network Programming course.

It demonstrates how to build the foundation of an online multiplayer game using:

- TCP sockets
- Threading
- Fixed-length headers
- JSON-based communication
- Server-authoritative architecture

## Project Structure
- `server.py` – Game server (no GUI)
- `client.py` – Game client (pygame-based, later extended)

## Concepts Covered
- Client/server architecture
- Multiplayer synchronization
- Game state processing
- Thread-per-client model
- Custom TCP protocol design

## Status
🚧 Blueprint stage — server and client structure implemented following lecture order.

## How to Run
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
